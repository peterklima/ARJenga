Facts about the game:
Jenga is a game of physical and mental skill. During the game, players take turns to remove a block 
from a tower and balance it on top, creating a taller and increasingly unstable structure as the game 
progresses. Jenga is played with 54 wooden blocks. Each block is three times as long as it is wide, 
and one fifth as thick as it is long 1.5×2.5×7.5 cm (0.59×0.98×3.0 in). The game ends when the tower 
falls in even a minor way—in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being 
knocked out to move to the top. The winner is the last person to successfully remove and place a block.
